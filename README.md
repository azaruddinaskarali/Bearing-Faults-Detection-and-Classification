#                                                         Rolling Element Bearing Fault Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning


Problem statement:

Rolling-element bearings are one of the most common components in industrial machinery. They are used in almost every rotating mechanism (from electric motors to gearboxes to conveyor belt systems) to allow the transmission of power along load bearing axles with a minimum of losses due to friction.

A typical rolling element bearing looks like:
